# Identicon-Generator

Open the folder pfp_maker and double click pfp_maker.py to run the program

This program randomly generates symmetrical 7 by 7 identicons with a border.
Once opened there are the options to generate a new pattern and a new colour separately.
Alteratively, the custom button can be used to import IDs to create customized patterns.

The general format of a ID: #hex_row1_row2_row3_row4_row5_row6_row7
#hex represents the colour of the pattern
each row is a binary string with a 0 representing white (#FFFFFF) and a 1 representing the colour (#hex)

Here are a few examples:

#d8b016_1100011_1101011_0000000_1001001_1001001_1011101_1101011
#fb50d5_1111111_1111111_0100010_1101011_1000001_1100011_1001001
